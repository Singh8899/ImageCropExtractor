    "prompt": "\nYou are given an image of dimensions 1400x760. \nYour job is to select 1, 2, or 3 rectangular/square crops that highlight the most important entity(s), so they can be assembled into a final collage at 1:1, 3:4, or 4:3 aspect ratio. \n\nKey points:\n1. Number of crops: choose 1-3 based on how many distinct, high-importance entities are present.\n2. Importance factors: centrality, visible faces, size in frame, eye contact, pose, and grouping.\n3. Crop placement: avoid overlap unless multiple people or entities are intentionally framed together.\n4. Coordinate constraints: all crop boxes must lie fully within the original image bounds.\n5. Final collage: selected crops will be resized and arranged to exactly fill a 1:1, 3:4, or 4:3 canvas—crops themselves do not need to match those aspect ratios.\nReturn the crops as a JSON array, where each object contains:\n    \"y1\": top-left y-coordinate\n    \"x1\": top-left x-coordinate\n    \"y2\": bottom-right y-coordinate\n    \"x2\": bottom-right x-coordinate\n",
